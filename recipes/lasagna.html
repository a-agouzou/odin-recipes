        Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that has become a classic comfort food enjoyed worldwide. 
        Its name is thought to have originated from the Greek word "lasanon," referring to a type of flat, thin pot. Traditional lasagna typically consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese. The dish is then baked until golden and bubbling.
        One of the distinctive features of lasagna is its layered composition. The pasta sheets act as a sturdy foundation, separating and supporting the various flavorful components. The meat sauce, often made with ground beef or a combination of meats, is cooked with tomatoes, herbs, and spices, 
        providing a savory and robust flavor
